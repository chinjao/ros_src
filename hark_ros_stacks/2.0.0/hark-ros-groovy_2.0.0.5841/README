HARK-ROS package for HARK
====================================================================================

This package provides seamless communication between HARK and ROS systems.

HARK is a robot audition software collaboratively developed by researchers in Okuno 
Laboratory at the Kyoto University and Honda Research Institute Japan Co.,Ltd.

ROS is a meta-operating system for robots developed by Willow Garage, Inc.

The HARK module in this package generates a ROS node, publishes/subscribes topics,
requests commands as a client, and responds to the client commands as a server.
Also, this provides ROS messages specialized for audio processing (e.g. audio stream)
which are freely published/subscribed between HARK and ROS.

Take care that only this package is based on BSD license, all other HARK packages 
follow different license agreements. For the main HARK license agreement, read COPY-
